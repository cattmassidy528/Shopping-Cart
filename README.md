# Shopping-Cart
i hate shopping carts and i did this wrong. i think i got it restocking, and i think thats the main problem to solve here. i've been looking at the davincis code of react shopping carts so long i don't even know what i'm supposed to be doing anymore. is that why we were changing pictures of produce into cathedrals and great halls like in the video? is that the theme? 
i'll redo it later. perhaps.  
but hey, check out my strapi-user-password repo! i built it real quick to gain an understanding of the underlying tech in hopes it'd help me with this cart assignment. it did not. but it works! my favorite part of it is how readable it is. whenever i wanted to axios me some data, i just followed the documentation instead of creating frankenseinian fetching function monsters.
